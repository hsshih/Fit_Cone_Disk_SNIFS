# Fit_Cone_Disk_SNIFS

This script is part of the [Three Dimensional Properties and Energetics of Radio-Jet Driven Outflows](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/786/1/3/pdf) paper. Part of the analysis of this paper include fitting the velocity maps of the gas outflow from radio-loud AGNs with a combination of biconical outflows and rotating disks. 

An example of the target velocity maps, fitted models, and residuals are shown below. The velocities are given in km/s and indicated by the colorbars.

The full results are published in The Astrophysical Journal on 2014 May 1.
